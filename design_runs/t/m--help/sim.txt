
Help text file for bch.exe program that generate binary (n,k) BCH code.

bch.exe program uses following input files:
bch.in - to specify input parameters of BCH code, only this file 
	should be changed (if the bch.exe cannot find bch.in file then
	it requests the user to type BCH code and program parameters
bch.vht - data needed to generate enc.vhd and sim.vhd and sim.txt files
bch1.vht - data needed to generate dec.vhd if t (no. of errors) = 1
bch2.vht - data needed to generate dec.vhd if t = 2
bch3.vht - data needed to generate dec.vhd if t > 2
bchs.vht - data needed to generate sym.cmd and sym.cme

bch.exe generates (overwrites !!!) following files:
const.vhd - VHDL package file that contains useful constants
enc.vhd - VHDL file for generating BCH code encoder
dec.vhd - VHDL file for generating BCH code decoder
sim.vhd - VHDL file for generating file for simulation encoder and decoder
sim.cmd - command file for simulation before synthesis
sim.cme - command file for simulation after synthesis

bch.in file should consists of following:
m= xx - specify width of Galois Field GF(2^m), n=2^m-1
t= xx - specify number of errors to be may corrected
program option (placed in bch.in):
-oxx - for t>2 circuit option;
	xx = 2 - parallel architecture
	xx = 3 - serial architecture - preferred.
-sxx - generate sym.cmd and sym.cme with specified 
	by xx simulation time (number of codewords to simulate)
	xx=0 - do not generate simulation command files.
-ix - xx - interleave number. The frequency of Berlekamp-Massey 
	Algorithm in comparison to data transfer (syndrome calculation) frequency.
	f_BMA = interleave * f_syn
-mxx - design optimization by extracting
	xx= 0 -  without optimisation
	xx= 1,2... - with optimization - introduce a new intermediate
		signal only if it reduces the number of XOR at least by xx

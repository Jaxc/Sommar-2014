findings:

9/6-14:
	There are no usual counters, so toggle rate will be hard to calculate without further knowledge of BCH.
	The encoder and decoder takes values in serial => buffer needed to feed values.
	When vdin is high the encoder requests new values, when it is low parity bits are sent. Making a FIFO buffer may be nessesary if the data comes at different rates.
	The sim.vhd is synthizable, i may want to synth all components and then provide input to the sim.vhd to let it handle the signals.
	the change between toggle and non toggle seems to be marginal

10/6-14
	using sim to propagate values:  652797 with sim, 721274 without sim.
